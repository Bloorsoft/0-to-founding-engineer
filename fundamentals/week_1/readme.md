### 1. **Introduction to Programming Concepts (Week 1)**

**Objective**: Familiarize learners with the basic concepts of programming, setting up their development environment, and writing their first lines of code.

**Key Concepts**:

- What is a programming language?
- Introduction to Python (syntax, comments)
- Setting up a development environment (e.g., VSCode)
- Running Python scripts

**Resources**:

- [Python.org Official Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
- Interactive tools like [Replit](https://replit.com/) for quick code testing.

**Project/Task**:

- **"Hello, World!" Program**: The classic first program that outputs a simple message.
- **Basic Calculator**: Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.).

**Optimization Idea**:

- Encourage them to experiment by changing the calculatorâ€™s behavior, like adding more complex operations (e.g., square roots, powers).
