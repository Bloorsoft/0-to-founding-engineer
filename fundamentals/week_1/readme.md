Objective: Familiarize learners with the basic concepts of programming, setting up their development environment, and writing their first lines of code.

Key Concepts:

What is a programming language?
Introduction to Python (syntax, comments)
Setting up a development environment (e.g., VSCode)
Running Python scripts
Resources:

Python.org Official Tutorial
Automate the Boring Stuff with Python
Interactive tools like Replit for quick code testing.
Project/Task:

"Hello, World!" Program: The classic first program that outputs a simple message.
Basic Calculator: Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.).
Optimization Idea:

Encourage them to experiment by changing the calculatorâ€™s behavior, like adding more complex operations (e.g., square roots, powers).
